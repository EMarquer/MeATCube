1. compression rate VS computation time
0. use the same similarity measure for everything, all the time
2. cross validation


>> analytical report

if compression with smith and mc kena, is coat still with a high performance


ordinal as actual ordinal instead of nominal

-----

1. fair comparison of method
2. comparison of time/space complexity
   1. also batching: 1 is better, more degrades more and more

further down the line:
optimize similarity benefits from compression ? i.e. alternate optimize similarity & compression
